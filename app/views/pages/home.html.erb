          Single-use plastics, like bags, bottles and straws, are wreaking havoc on our environment and its inhabitants.  Have you ever thought about how to solve this problem? It's a massive endeavor with no simple solution.  However, the most important thing we can do is reduce how much we consume. <br /> Less Demand = Less Production = Less Waste

      <h2>Why start with one-time use plastics?</h2>
     <div class="line1">
       Worldwde, 500 billion to 1 trillion plastic bags are consumed each year.  A plastic bag takes up to 1000 years to decompose, and when it finally does, the results are toxic.  Simply put, plastic is made to last forever and designed to be thrown away.

     <div class="line2">
       Our environment is reaching a critical mass of polution.  There is a swirling mass of plastic in the pacific ocean twice the size of Texas.  Over 44% of all seabirds have ingested pieces of plastic.  1000 sea creatures die each day due to plastic pollution.
